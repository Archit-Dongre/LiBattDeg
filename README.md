# LiBattDeg
This dataset is generated by P2D model for Li-ion battery, the out put will be the degradation of battery during charging.

# Dataset
This dataset is generated by Porous Electrode Pseudo 2-dimensional Model (P2D).
The assumption of this current model:
1. The battery opperates in 23 degree C
2. Degradation of the only happens during charging
3. initial SoC 0.2
4. initial SoH 1e-8

Dataset
SOC = State of charge of the battery (0% = empty; 100% = full)
SOH = State of Health of the battery (It is determined by the thickness of the SEI layer)
Power = output power (positive sign represets charging; negative sign represents discharging.)
